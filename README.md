## Web version

If you want to use this package in its web version and are using a bundler, you'll have to manually copy web workers.

### Example with [Spike](https://www.spike.cf/) SSG

By using [copy-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/kevlened/copy-webpack-plugin) in your `app.js`:

```js
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin')
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  // ...
  afterSpikePlugins: [
    new CopyWebpackPlugin([{
      from: path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/electre-js/lib/workers'),
      to: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public/workers')
    }])
  ]
}
```
